## Why this week exists (the “so what”)

**Inventory calculations are the bridge between biology and decisions.**
If your snapshot is wrong, your reproduction strategy, semen strategy (sexed vs beef), housing plan, and growth plan will all be wrong—*even if your math is perfect*.

This week trains students to:
1) produce a **defensible snapshot** of the current herd and
2) compute **flows (dynamics)** with correct denominators and time windows, then
3) translate those numbers into a **growth strategy for CDREC (CURC)**.

## Learning objectives (students should be able to…)

By the end of lecture + lab, students can:

- Explain **herd statics** (state) vs **herd dynamics** (flows).
- Define **risk vs rate** and why mixing them breaks inventory math.
- Compute and interpret:
  - culling/removal rate
  - mortality/death rate (**cows vs calves**)
  - replacement/entry rate
  - calving/freshening rate
  - herd turnover rate
- Identify which metrics are true **synonyms** vs **near‑synonyms**.
- Run DC305 commands to build a farm snapshot and extract needed numerators/denominators.
