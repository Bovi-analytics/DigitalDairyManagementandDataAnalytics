# Online

To access computing resources for the introductory data science courses offered by Utrecht University we will make use of the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) computing services linked to the course drive storage.

If this is your first time accessing Google Colab, make sure you have a registered gmail address. You should have access to [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0AP9RxLUFwHObUk9PVA) 'Shared drive' in your Google Drive. If not, send an email to the course teacher to get access.

Make sure you get familiar with Google Colab by reading and trying to run your first pieces of code in the '[Welcome To Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_qUMu7G1-yFhizqY8TXoxlWo2Nc82IyJ?usp=drive_link)' notebook.
