# Reproducible & FAIR data science

## What are the FAIR principles

**FAIR data** is [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data "Data") which meets the **FAIR principles** of [findability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Findability "Findability"), accessibility, [interoperability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperability "Interoperability"), and [reusability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusability "Reusability") (FAIR).^[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data#cite_note-FAIR_principles_2016-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data#cite_note-2)^ The acronym and principles were defined in a March 2016 paper in the journal [*Scientific Data*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Data_(journal) "Scientific Data (journal)") by a consortium of scientists and organizations.^[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data#cite_note-FAIR_principles_2016-1)^

## Get to know the principles (1)

-   Get familiar with FAIR by looking at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K40utIzUzOk).

-   Read the intial [publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) on *The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardschip.*

-   Explore the [vision of Cornell University on FAIR principles](https://data.research.cornell.edu/data-management/sharing/fair/) and their cheatsheets.

## Get to know the principles (2)

-   Check for reproducible advise in the [tutorials](https://bovi-analytics.com/tutorials/) at the bovi-analytics website.

-   Discuss with the entire team and Dr. Miel Hostens (contact him on his desk) on how this will reflect on your team project.

## Findable

The first step in (re)using data is to find them. [Metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata "Metadata") and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. [Machine-readable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine-readable_data "Machine-readable data") metadata are essential for automatic [discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_discovery "Data discovery") of datasets and services, so this is an essential component of the FAIRification process.

## Findable

-   F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier

-   F2. Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below)

-   F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe

-   F4. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource

## Accessible

Once the user finds the required data, they need to know how they can be accessed, possibly including [authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication "Authentication") and [authorisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization "Authorization").

## Accessible

-   A1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol

-   A1.1 The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable

-   A1.2 The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary

-   A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available

## Interoperable

The data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for [analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis "Data analysis"), [storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_storage "Data storage"), and [processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_processing "Data processing").

## Interoperable

-   I1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.

-   I2. (Meta)data use [vocabularies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_vocabulary "Controlled vocabulary") that follow FAIR principles

-   I3. (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data

## Reusable

The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings.

## Reusable

-   R1. (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes

-   R1.1. (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license

-   R1.2. (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance

-   R1.3. (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards

# Naming convention

## Why do we need this

-   Dairy data science is **multimodal**, **longitudinal**, and **collaborative**
-   Naming is not cosmetic — it is **infrastructure**
-   Most downstream issues are caused by:
    -   Ambiguity
    -   Inconsistency
    -   Silent semantic drift

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 40 Minutes, 4 Takeaways

1.  Naming conventions are **scientific decisions**
2.  Bad names silently break analyis and models
3.  Conventions must scale across projects & people
4.  Governance matters more than documentation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Dairy Data Reality

-   Multiple farms
-   Multiple vendors
-   Multiple countries
-   Multiple disciplines:
    -   Nutrition
    -   Health
    -   Behavior
    -   Production

**→ Names are the only shared language**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What Is a Naming Convention?

> A set of agreed‑upon rules for creating **unique, informative, and stable names** for data objects.

Applies to:

-   Variables

-   Tables

-   Files

-   Visuals

-   Ontology terms

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Naming ≠ Style Preference

Bad naming causes:

-   Wrong joins

-   Broken pipelines

-   Invalid within/between farm comparisons

These errors **do not throw exceptions**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Common Dairy Data Failures

-   `DIM`, `days_in_milk`, `DaysInMilk`
-   `milk_yield`, `MilkYieldKg`, `MY`
-   `other`, `Other`, `OTHER`
-   `lactation_stage` vs `lactation_stages`

Each creates a **new semantic entity**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Names Encode Meaning

A good name answers:

-   What?

-   For whom?

-   In what unit?

-   At what level?

-   Over what time window?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Core Design Principles

1.  **Consistency over cleverness**
2.  **Explicit over implicit**
3.  **Stable over convenient**
4.  **Readable by humans and machines**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Scope of a Naming Convention

You must define rules for:

-   ✅ Variables
-   ✅ Tables
-   ✅ Files
-   ✅ Features
-   ✅ Categories
-   ✅ Ontology terms

Partial conventions always fail.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Case Sensitivity Matters

Choose **one** and enforce it.

Recommended: - **CamelCase** for data schemas - **lower_snake_case** for code variables

Never mix within the same layer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Variable Naming Pattern

**It's now the perfect time to decide on a convention used for the project**
