## Why?

* DHI
* Management
* Research 

## How?

* Test-day milk recording
* Milk meters

## Lactation yield

## Cumulative yield

* Test interval method

##Question

Which factors influence the lactationcurve? 

## Making lactations comparable

### Energy-corrected milk (ECM)

Adjusting to 3.5% fat and 3.2% protein:

ECM = 0.327 × milk (lb) + 12.95 × fat (lb) + 7.2 × protein (lb)

## 305-ME / 305-AA

Applying correction factors:

* Age at freshening
* Parity
* Season of calving
* Milking frequency
* Previous days open
* Breed
* Climate regions

## Management Level Milk (MLM)

Estimated average milk production on test day if all cows were:

* 150 days in milk
* In second lactation
* Producing milk with 4.0% fat and 3.3% protein

MLM is only calculated on cows with less than 306 days in milk

## Assignment 
Look at the milk production summaries of CURC and tell me what you think. 
What is going well, what is a potential weakness?
