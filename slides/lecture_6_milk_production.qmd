## monitoring milk yield 

- What is the goal of the farm  
- What is the size of the farm 
- What management system do they use > seasonal, grazing, free stall etc. 


## Things to take into account looking at data 

- Test day average vs rolling averages 
- What are you trying to optimize?

## Past/Present/Future

Past: Rolling average 

Present: Test day average

Future: Production < 100 DIM

Far Future: Heifer production

## What dictates milk production


phenotype = genotype + environment 


## Genetics 

$$
\Delta G_{year} =
\frac{
\sqrt{\text{reliability}} \times \text{selection intensity} \times \sqrt{\text{genetic variance}}
}{
\text{generation interval}
}
$$

## Effect of selection differs

- Traits associated with **physical shape and size**  
  - High heritability (≥ 40%)

- Traits related to **milk and solids yield**  
  - Moderate heritability (15–30%)

- Traits associated with **health and fertility**  
  - Low heritability (≤ 10%)

## Calculation of Breeding Values

$$
y = Xb + Zu + e
$$

- **y** = observed phenotypes  
- **b** = fixed effects (e.g., sex, management)  
- **u** = random genetic effects (breeding values)  
- **e** = residual error  
- **X, Z** = link observations to effects


## What do we get from this?

- Each animal receives an estimate of genetic merit  
- Called **Predicted Transmitting Ability (PTA)**  
- PTA = breeding value ÷ 2

**Note:**  
Real U.S. animal models are more complex and include:
- Contemporary groups  
- Herd-by-sire effects  
- Permanent environmental effects


## Genomic prediction

**What is genomic prediction?**
- Uses **DNA information + phenotypes + pedigree** to estimate genetic merit
- DNA markers = **SNP** (positions in the genome with two variants)



**Why use genomics?**
- DNA is **not influenced by environment**
- Improvs accuracy of breeding value estimation
- Allows evaluation of **young animals without records**


## How are genomic PTA calculated?

- Estimate SNP effects using a **predictor population** with reliable PTA
- Combine:
  - Genomic predictions from SNP
  - Parent averages (PA)
  - Traditional pedigree + phenotype evaluations


## Net merit dollar value

The expected difference in lifetime profit (in USD) of a cow (or bull’s daughters) compared to a reference animal, due solely to genetics, assuming typical U.S. management and prices.


*“If I replace one genetically average cow with this one, how much more (or less) money will I make over her lifetime?”*
