# Inventory Management in Dairy Systems

## Why Inventory Calculations Matter

-   Inventory is the **constraint layer** under everything else.
-   If a herd inventory snapshot is wrong → future decisions will all be wrong.
-   Today:
    -   Build the mental model
    -   Understand the math
    -   Lab on CDREC flow

## Learning Outcomes

By the end you can:

-   Distinguish state vs flow
-   Define risk vs rate
-   Compute and interpret key herd dynamics metrics
-   Avoid synonym traps
-   Use DC305 to extract numerators/denominators for CDREC strategy

## Two herds, same cow count, different future

-   Herd A and Herd B both have 1,000 cows today
-   One shrinks, one grows
-   The difference is **flows**

```

## Vocabulary

-   **Statics:** snapshot at a moment
    -   “what exists”
-   **Dynamics:** movement over time
    -   “where it is going”

## DC305

Choose the “as‑of” date intentionally

Set date in cowfile to “today”

``` text
SETDAY\*
```

Set date to last event entry date

``` text
SETDAY\E
```

Set date to most recent test date

``` text
SETDAY\T
```

Set date to selected date

``` text
SETDAY\mm/dd/yy
```

## Why date matters

-   “Last 365 days” depends on file date
-   If the backup date is wrong → your rates are wrong

# Definitions

## Risk vs Rate (the core confusion)

Most bad inventory math comes from mixing:

-   Probabilities and
-   Time‑based rates

## Risk (probability)

-   Fraction experiencing event over specified period
-   Unitless
-   Must specify time window

## Example - Culling Risk

**Definition**

Probability that a cow is culled during a specified time period.

$$
Risk = \frac{\text{Number of cows culled during period}}{\text{Number of cows at risk at start}} 
$$

-   Unit: none (0–1)
-   Time period must be defined
-   Bounded by 1

## Better example - Annual Culling Risk

Suppose:

-   100 cows at start of year
-   20 cows culled during the year

$$
Risk = 20/100 = 0.20 
$$

👉 20% probability of being culled during that year

This is a **probability over one year**.

## Rate

-   Events per unit time (per cow‑time)
-   Units: 1/time
-   Supports unequal follow‑up

## Incidence Rate

**Definition**

Speed at which culling events occur.

$$
Rate = \frac{\text{Number of cullings}}{\text{Total cow-time at risk}} 
$$

-   Unit: 1 / time (e.g., per cow-year)
-   Uses animal-time
-   No upper bound

## Cow-year — definition

A **cow-year** is **animal-time at risk**:

- **1 cow-year = one cow present and at risk for 1 year**
- More generally: sum the time each cow is “in the population at risk,” expressed in years.

This is the recommended denominator logic for herd turnover: **exits / animal time at risk**. 

---

## Cow-year — formula

$$
\text{Cow-years} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\text{days cow } i \text{ is at risk during period}}{365}
$$

Key idea: **time** belongs in the denominator when you report a *rate*.

## Example: counting cow-years

- Cow A present all year: \(365/365 = 1.00\) cow-year
- Cow B present 180 days: \(180/365 = 0.49\) cow-year
- Cow C present 90 days: \(90/365 = 0.25\) cow-year

Total exposure = \(1.00 + 0.49 + 0.25 = 1.74\) cow-years


## Herd-level approximation

For a 12-month window, if herd size is fairly stable:

$$
\text{Cow-years} \approx \text{Average number of cows present during the year} \times \text{1 year}
$$

This is why many “annual” turnover metrics use **average milking + dry cows** as the denominator.

## Example: Annual Culling Rate

Suppose:

-   20 cows culled
-   Total time at risk = 90 cow-years\
    (because cows leave during the year)

$$ 
Rate = 20 / 90 = 0.222 \text{ per cow-year} 
$$

👉 0.222 cullings per cow-year

This is a **speed**, not a probability.

## Why They Are Not the Same

Risk asks:

> What fraction of cows are culled during the year?

Rate asks:

> How fast are cows being culled?

Different denominators:

-   Risk → cows

-   Rate → cow-time

## Why words break math

-   “30% cull risk” - Over a month? year? lactation?

-   “0.35 removals per cow‑year” - interpretable

Rule

-   If you can’t attach a time window, you don’t have a rate.

## Definitions that won’t betray you

Each metric has a:

-   numerator

-   denominator

-   time window

-   population scope

# Metrics

## Removal / Culling rate — definition

-   **Exits / cow‑year**
-   Confusion
    -   Exits may include sold (alive) + culled + deaths (be explicit)
    -   Sometimes used as synonyms
    -   In rigorous use: removal includes all exits; cull may exclude deaths/live culls
-   Your job: define numerator explicitly

## Mortality / Death rate — definition

-   **Deaths / cow‑year**
-   Always specify population:
    -   cows
    -   calves
    -   heifers

## Replacement rate — definition

-   **First‑lactation entries / cow‑year**
-   In a steady state (no growth) :
    -   replacement rate ≈ exit rate

## Calving / Freshening rate — definition

-   **Calvings / cow‑year**
-   Sometimes operationalized as fresh cows per month (be explicit)

## Herd turnover rate — definition

-   Proportion replaced over time
-   Think “stall slots” being refilled

## Involuntary vs voluntary removals

-   **Voluntary culling** → economically driven decision
    -   Low milk yield
    -   Reproductive decisions
    -   Strategic replacement
-   **Involuntary culling** → biological constraint
    -   Mastitis
    -   Lameness
    -   Mortality

# Inventory math

## Build it from components

Inventory is not one number.

It is:

-   entries

-   exits

-   time

## The simplest dynamic identity

$$
N_{t+1} = N_t + \text{Entries} - \text{Exits} 
$$

Stable size implies:

$$
\text{Entry rate} \approx \text{Exit rate} 
$$

## What changes herd size?

If you want growth:

-   increase entries
-   decrease exits
-   or both

…but constraints intervene.

## Herd constraints (farm growth realism)

-   housing / stalls
-   heifer capacity
-   repro performance
-   calf survival
-   transition cow health

## Visual

Constraints as a funnel

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
A[Pregnancy performance] --> B[Calvings]
B --> C[Heifer survival]
C --> D[Heifers to breed]
D --> E[Heifers calving‑in]
E --> F[Milk cow slots]
```

## Fertility: the pipeline driver

Pregnancy performance changes:

-   timing of calvings

-   replacement flow

-   age structure

## Sexed semen

Inventory consequences

-   increases female calf supply
-   may reduce conception
-   adds lag & variability

## Where sexed semen fits in the pipeline

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
A[Semen choice] --> B[Preg outcomes]
B --> C[Calves born]
C --> D[Heifer survival]
D --> E[Replacements]
```

## Beef semen

Inventory consequences

-   shifts calves away from replacements
-   increases calf value
-   requires replacement confidence

Use beef semen only when:

-   replacement pipeline is secure

-   growth targets are compatible with heifer supply

# Synonym trap

Often treated as synonyms:

-   death rate ≈ mortality rate (if same denominator/time)

-   cull rate ≈ removal rate (IF deaths included)

Not guaranteed synonyms:

-   replacement rate vs turnover rate (context‑dependent)

-   calving rate vs pregnancy rate (related but not same)

# Lab skill

## Create defensible snapshot

A snapshot is defensible if it:

-   is date‑anchored

-   reconciles across reports

-   defines denominators

-   documents inclusion/exclusion

## Grow CDREC (CURC) responsibly

Levers:

-   reduce involuntary exits

-   improve pregnancy performance

-   tune semen strategy (sexed vs beef)

-   manage heifer inventory

## Lab deliverable

Students submit:

-   Snapshot (counts)

-   Dynamics sheet (rates)

-   Strategy presentation for growth
