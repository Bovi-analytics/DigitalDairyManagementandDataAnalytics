# Digital Agriculture

## What is Digital Agriculture

::: {style="font-size: 0.8em;"}
> "Digital agriculture refers to the use of digital technologies, information, and communication tools in various aspects of agriculture to enhance productivity, efficiency, and sustainability. This field leverages advancements in technology, such as sensors, automation, data analytics, and connectivity, to collect, analyze, and apply data-driven insights to agricultural practices.

# Course learning goals and philosophy

## Course learning objectives (part 1)

1.  Collect, organize, and clean dairy farm datasets from herd management.

2.  Apply statistical and computational methods (e.g., Excel, R, Python, or similar tools) to analyze dairy performance data.

3.  Identify strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of different data types used in dairy management.

## Course learning objectives (part 2)

1.  Interpret and critique dairy datasets in relation to biological, economic, and management contexts.

2.  Create visualizations, written reports or presentations to communicate data-driven insights with consideration for ethical use of data.

3.  Synthesize herd-level data into a decision support framework and contribute to a SWOT analysis in collaboration with herd managers.

## Topics that will be covered

::: incremental
-   Week 1 - Introduction, programming and team project kick-off
-   Week 2 - Data in agriculture
-   Week 3 - Technologies in agriculture
-   Week 4 - Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
-   Week 5 - ...

## Weekly programming assignment

-   One of the learning goals is to actively stimulate you by weekly programming assignments & assessments

-   We will use the [Dodona](https://dodona.be/) platform for that. Make sure to try if you have access to the course.

-   [Link to the course](https://dodona.be/en/courses/2982/?secret=jniug)

## Weekly programming assignment

Sign in to Dodona using your Cornell Microsoft365 or Google sign-in

# Course overview

## Homepage

[https://github.com/Bovi-analytics/](https://bovi-analytics.github.io/DairyHealthManagement/)[Beasts & Bytes](https://bovi-analytics.github.io/BeastAndBytes/)

-   All relevant course materials (and history)
-   Links to Teams, GitHub, Dodona, etc.
-   Let's take a tour!

## Activities: Prepare, Participate, Practice, Perform {.smaller}

-   **Prepare:** Introduce new content and prepare for lectures by completing the readings
-   **Participate:** Attend and actively participate in lectures and labs, herd visits
-   **Practice:** Practice your programming skills
-   **Perform:** Put together what you've learned to analyze real-world data
    -   Dodona assignments

## Grading {.smaller}

The overall team project score will be multiplied by the % of correctly submitted weekly assignments individually.

Example:

-   Your team project is graded as a group to 16/20

-   You individually submitted 80% correct assignments

-   Your end score is 0.8\*16/20 = 12.8/20

## Support

-   Office hours
-   Ask (or even better help answering) questions during the course!!!
-   Teams
-   Reserve email for questions on personal matters

## Announcements

-   During classes or email
-   If unclear, contact me

## Diversity + inclusion {.smaller}

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit.

# Course policies

## Team project

-   **Team update fridays** are supposed to be completed collaboratively.

-   Most of the times we will meet in classrooms at the **Morrison Hall** building.

## Academic integrity

> To uphold the [Cornell Academic Integrity Guide](https://deanoffaculty.cornell.edu/faculty-and-academic-affairs/academic-integrity/guidelines-for-students/):
>
> -   I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
>
> -   I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and
>
> -   I will act if the Code is compromised.

## Farm data

-   Be aware that

    -   the participating farmers are sharing sometimes sensitive and personal data with you (part of the course).

    -   you are supposed to use that data for educational purposes only.

    -   your professional conduct is expected.

    -   you influence future participation of the collaborating farm(s).

## Most importantly!

Ask if you're not sure if something violates a policy!

# Making Data Science Applications in Agriculture course a success

## Five tips for success

1.  Help me understanding your needs as well.
2.  Read all the preparation material (if provided) before the lesson begins.
3.  Ask questions and actively collaborate with entire team.
4.  Perform the programming assignments.
5.  Don't let a week pass by with lingering questions.

## This week's first tasks

-   Get a Dodona account if you don't have one, you'll need it for Wednesday first lab.
-   Communicate your Gmail account with miel.hostens\@cornell.edu so I can connect you to the Beasts&Bytes Google Drive and Google Colab environment.
