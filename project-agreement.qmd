### \*Questions from the farm manager

-   Milk production (defined on ...)

    -   Provide long term milk yield analysis, including ECM and components, and analysis for a seasonal effect

    -   Do changes in components compensate

    -   What is the evolution of the relative production of heifers versus cows

    -   Visualize lactation curves per parity

    -   Are cows in the tie stall vs free stalls producing differently

-   Inventory clarifications:

    -   Are DC305 inventory correct for stall numbers/cow numbers

    -   DHI herd summary said that 88 death cows in last year, correct?

    -   Is the herd actually shrinking

    -   Death loss

        -   What’s going on?

-   Reproduction

    -   TBD

### Notes

-   This table should be reviewed jointly by the team, the farmer(s), and Professor Hostens following the final presentation.
-   The checklist is meant to support transparency, self‑reflection, and assessment alignment.
